# Project Record: Feature Extraction & Line Estimation (Spring 2020)
@Contributors: Yuhan Liu & Yunhai Han  
@Time        : April 5 - 

## Goal
To find or propose the best algorithm for extracting feature points (with known geometry information) from the image frames with (hopefully) sub-pixel accuracy.

## Approaches

### **Key Point Method**: Extract feature points, fit lines to them, find intersections.  
* **Feature Detection**  
    * SIFT
    * Harris Corner

* **Line Fitting**  
    * SVD

### **Direct Line Estimate Method**: Extract lines or contours, find intersections.
* Sub-pixel Accurate Canny Edge Detection
* Hough Transform

## [Geometry Correspending Methods](https://github.com/AutonomousVehicleLaboratory/camera_auto-calib/blob/master/Overview/geometry_correspondence.pdf)
**Overview**: Take an object reference image, manually pick points (*reference points*) with known geometry from it, correspond *reference points* with extracted (sub-pixel accurate) points by descriptors.

## Algorithm Assessment Methods
* **Simulation**:  
Simulates a stop sign/license plate video, with known camera intrinsics and extrinsics, as well as known feature points 2D and 3D coordinates (sub-pixel accurate). Run above algorithms on the video. Compare the estimated 2D coordinates with the ground truth, and calibrate the camera with these estimated points to see the final performance.
